# Indie Studio

## Introduction
A microformat/schema theme aimed at design professionals. The content comes first with simple image grids. A simple and elegant way to push your content to the world with 'POSSE' (see https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and backfeed. 

## Image Reveal Built In
Images can be set to animate into view as the reader scrolls down the page. All that is required is for 2 classes to be set on the image.

'''
"sr top" - Animates the image from the top
"sr right" - Animates the image from the right
"sr bottom" - Animates the image from the bottom
"sr left" - Animates the image from the left
'''

Simples!

## Developer Friendly
Built with developers in mind. File organsation has been considered to make a more efficent workflow. Gulp has been used to process all of those boring tasks. That has allowed us to keep the JS and CSS in small, easy to understand files.

To find out more about Gulp check out the [Gulp WordPress Framework](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp).

The code is documented as per PHPDocs specification. This allows all functions ect to be output into a specification document if required.
