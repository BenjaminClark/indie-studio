# Indie Studio

## Introduction
A microformat/schema theme aimed at design professionals. The content comes first with simple image grids. A simple and elegant way to push your content to the world with 'POSSE' (see https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and backfeed. 

## Developer Friendly
Built with developers in mind. File organsation has been considered to make a more efficent workflow. Gulp has been used to process all of those boring tasks. That has allowed us to keep the JS and CSS in small, easy to understand files.

To find out more about Gulp check out the [Gulp WordPress Framework](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp).
